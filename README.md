# What is Regular Expression Denial of Service?
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS) and [OSWAP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) have decent explainations. Basically certain RegExes can take a long time for certain inputs. Here's a real example.

```javascript
console.time('benchmark');
/^(([a-z])+.)+[A-Z]([a-z])+$/.test('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa');
console.timeEnd('benchmark');
benchmark: 0.060ms

console.time('benchmark');
/^(([a-z])+.)+[A-Z]([a-z])+$/.test('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa');
console.timeEnd('benchmark');
benchmark: 308.656ms

console.time('benchmark');
/^(([a-z])+.)+[A-Z]([a-z])+$/.test('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa');
console.timeEnd('benchmark');
benchmark: 3179.829ms

console.time('benchmark');
/^(([a-z])+.)+[A-Z]([a-z])+$/.test('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa');
console.timeEnd('benchmark');
benchmark: 22159.769ms  // 22 seconds

// You can guess what would happen if you test the RegEx with 100 repeating characters.
console.time('benchmark');
/^(([a-z])+.)+[A-Z]([a-z])+$/.test( 'a'.repeat(100) );
console.timeEnd('benchmark');
benchmark: ops...
```

# Installing ReDoS

As usual, install with NPM.
```
npm i -g git+https://git@github.com/panga/RegEx-DoS.git
```

You can run redos on the CLI:
```bash
# Use "Find" to run Regex-DoS for any set of JS files you want.
find . -name "*.js" -not -path "./node_modules/*" -exec redos {} \;
```

Or to run as a node module:
```javascript
const redos = require('redos');

redos({ content: " 'aaaa'.split(/a+b?c*/g); " }, (regexNodes) => {
  regNodes.printAll();
});
```
